##### kNN algorithm
kNN is the easiest machine learning algorithm. It's a classification algorithm.
The way kNN works is by computing the Euclidian distance between the item 
we're trying to classify with the rest of the items. And by taking the most represented
items from the list of k items.
However, kNN number of computations explodes with the data used.
